# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game where two players take turns drawing either an "O" or an "X" in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares. The winner ðŸ¥‡ is the first player to get three of the same symbols in a row.

## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 (usually "X") takes the first turn, followed by Player 2 (usually "O").
- Players alternate placing their symbol in an empty square until one player gets three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- If all squares are filled and no player has three symbols in a row, the game is a draw.
